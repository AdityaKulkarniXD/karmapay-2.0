# KarmaPay Integration Guide

## Overview

KarmaPay is designed to simplify the integration of multiple payment gateways into your application, providing a unified, secure, and efficient way to handle online payments. By leveraging KarmaPay, developers can use a single API endpoint to access a variety of payment services, minimizing client-side code and shifting payment handling logic to the server side for better security and efficiency.

## Step-by-Step Workflow

### Step 1: Store API Keys

Initially, KarmaPay requires you to store the necessary API keys for all the payment gateways you intend to use. This is a one-time setup process that ensures secure communication between KarmaPay and the payment providers.

- **Action**: Configure API keys through the settings page at KarmaPay Settings.

### Step 2: Create an Order

To initiate a payment, use the KarmaPay Create Order API to generate a new order. This action creates a dedicated payment page hosted on the specified payment domain.

- **Action**: Use the Create Order API. Refer to the [KarmaPay API Documentation](https://karmapay.docs.api) for detailed instructions.

### Step 3: Redirect the Customer

Once an order is created, a payment page is dynamically generated in the format `<user_domain>/payments/(order_id)`. Redirect your customer to this page for them to complete their payment.

- **Action**: Redirect the user to the generated payment page.

### Step 4: Payment Completion and Cleanup

After the payment is completed, the payment page is automatically deleted, ensuring that no sensitive information is retained longer than necessary.

## Benefits of Using KarmaPay

- **Simplified Integration**: A single API endpoint replaces multiple integrations, saving time and reducing complexity.
- **Enhanced Security**: By handling payments server-side and following best practices, KarmaPay ensures the secure processing of transactions.
- **Scalability**: KarmaPay's architecture is built to handle growing transaction volumes, making it suitable for businesses of all sizes.
- **Flexibility**: Easily switch between different payment gateways or add new ones without altering your application's codebase.

KarmaPay streamlines the payment process, making it easier for developers to integrate multiple payment gateways and for customers to make payments seamlessly. By centralizing payment gateway management, KarmaPay offers a robust solution for businesses looking to expand their payment options and enhance their security posture.
